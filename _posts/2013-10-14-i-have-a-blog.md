So I have decied to check out Jekyll and build myself a geeky blog ٩(-̮̮̃•̃)۶. I will try to write a little bit about the technologies I work with or just find cool. This blog will be mainly about web, front-end web, JavaScript ... you probably catch my drift. Actually when I say web I mean mobile first web since half of the devices using the Internet are mobile-ish. And let us not forget that mobile devices are still slow and very limited in terms of resources, so great part of the articles in the blog will be about optimizations. Stuff that you have probably read about already in [Jake Archibald's blog](http://jakearchibald.com/) or [Paul Irish's blog](http://www.paulirish.com/) or insert-list-of-many-many-more-awesome-web-devs.

Enjoy reading (｡◕ ‿ ◕｡)
